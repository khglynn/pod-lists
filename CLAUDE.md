## About This Project

Automated pipeline that extracts recommendations from podcasts and routes them to the right platforms.

**Source of truth:** Neon (Postgres) - all data lives here first, then syncs to other platforms.

**Destinations:**
- **Music** → Neon → Spotify playlists (one per show)
- **Movies/TV** → Neon → Notion + Trakt
- **Books** → Neon → Notion
- **Apps/Products** → Neon → Notion

**Data strategy:** Avoid transcription when possible. Many podcasts list songs/recommendations on their websites (FREE). Use cascading logic: website → free transcripts → transcript API → Whisper (last resort).

## Key Abbreviations

| Abbreviation | Full Name | Data Source |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| SOP | Switched On Pop | Website show notes |
| TAL | This American Life | Website song credits |
| PCHH | Pop Culture Happy Hour | TBD (check for transcripts) |

## Tech Stack

- **Database:** Neon (Postgres) - source of truth
- **Framework:** Next.js (TypeScript)
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **APIs:** Spotify (via MCP), Notion, Firecrawl (scraping), Claude (extraction)

## Spotify MCP

We have a custom Spotify MCP built for this exact use case!

**Location:** `~/DevKev/personal/spotify-bulk-actions-mcp/`
**Repo:** https://github.com/khglynn/spotify-bulk-actions-mcp

**Key tools:**
- `batch_search_tracks` - Search songs with confidence scoring (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- `import_and_create_playlist` - CSV → playlist workflow
- `create_playlist_from_search_results` - Create from batch search
- `add_reviewed_tracks` - Add human-reviewed uncertain matches

**Settings:** Configured in `~/.claude/settings.local.json`

## Always-Allowed (project-specific)

## Project-Specific Notes

- **SOP and TAL complete** - Both shows backfilled, playlists active
- **Scrape before transcribe** - SOP and TAL have song data on their websites
- **Mosaic artwork done** - See `marketing/` for playlist cover generators
