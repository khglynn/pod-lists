"""
TAL (This American Life) Episode Scraper - Unified pipeline entry point.

Chains the existing TAL scripts: fetch → parse → fill_songs.
Designed to be called by the orchestrator (run_pipeline.py).

For the full individual scripts, see:
  - fetch.py: Fetches raw markdown via Firecrawl
  - parse.py: Parses episode JSON files
  - fill_songs.py: Inserts missing songs to database

Usage:
    python scrape.py --dry-run           # Preview what would be scraped
    python scrape.py --execute           # Fetch, parse, and insert
    python scrape.py --execute --yes     # No confirmation prompt
